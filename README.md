### WebPack Project Starter

#### Goal:

Create a `webpack` project starter from the ground up, to better understand the entire application architecture, versus using a project starter like `create-react-app` that keeps me out of the nuts and bolts.

Below you will find a rough list of the items this project explores, and the tools used to satisfy the requirements for a true project starter.

1. App Framework

`node`

2. App Bundler

`webpack`

3. Test Framework

`jest`

*Coming Soon*

4. Pipeline

`circleCI`
